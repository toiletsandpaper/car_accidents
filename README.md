# Inspecting affect of road bumps and pits on car accident in Russia

## What is it about?

This set is totaly unrepresentive, because major part of accident is "self-handled" by drivers.
For example: you would never waste your time on waiting inspectors to write a report that you have a flat tire because of this road pit in the middle of the night.
You'll just change that tire and move on without any report. So because of that - this data is useless, but applied methods to this "research" is well working to make other researches.

## Folder Structure

All data will be collected `in-script`, becuase its to large to store on github, even in LFS.

NOTE: All files totally **will take ~7.5 GB of your disk memory**. This is totally unefficient, because I've wanted to save fixed version and .csv for DataFrame, so fell free to fix and even make pull requests.
